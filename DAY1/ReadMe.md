    Skywater-pdk – Contains all the foundry provided PDK related files
    Open_pdks – Contains scripts that are used to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source PDK to EDA tool compatibility
    Sky130A – The open-source compatible PDK files

# Importing package

Different software dependencies are needed to run OpenLANE. To import these into the OpenLANE tool we need to run: package require openlane 0.9
